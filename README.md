## Flix Part 1


The following was completed


 User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.


 Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
 In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
 In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

### Notes
the dependencies were hard to set up as they got updated ! I had a hard time figuring out how to set them up the right way without getting an error.
